# Loan Status Prediction 
This project is a part of my self projects as I dive deeper into the field of Data Science.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the loan defaulters early on based on their current habits. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
Recent news articles have highlighted that Indian banks have written off loans amounting to â‚¹10.6 lakh crore over a span of 5 years ([Link](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/indian-banks-write-off-106-lakh-crore-in-5-years-50-linked-to-large-corporates/article67604297.ece)). This emphasizes the critical need for banks to predict in advance which customers are likely to default on their loans. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to uncover relationships between various features such as current loan amount, credit score, delinquency history, etc., associated with customers. This proactive approach will empower banks to make informed decisions, potentially saving significant amounts of money in the future.
I have also created a presentation on the project that would be easily understood by the stakholders thus bridging the gap between technical and management teams, which would help in accelerated decision making. 

## Needs of this project

- Data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning
- Loan status predictions

## Getting Started

1. We initiated the project by delving into data exploration and visualization to discern relationships between different features.
2. Throughout the process, we engineered new features such as credit utilization amount, total delinquencies, debt-to-income ratio, etc., with the aim of enhancing the efficiency of our model.
3. Given that the data exhibited significant imbalance, we employed various sampling techniques including resampling, undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE to rectify the imbalance issue.
4. Subsequently, we applied a range of machine learning algorithms and fine-tuned models such as logistic regression and XGBClassifier to achieve optimal results.
5. Continual refinement remains ongoing for the project. Learning is an iterative process, and as we acquire new insights, we revisit our previous projects to incorporate these learnings and improve the model.
6. I recommend going through the provided Jupyter notebook and slide deck for a more detailed and comprehensible overview of our methodology and findings.
